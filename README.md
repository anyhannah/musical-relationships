# musical-relationships

In this group project (collaborated with Jack Armstrong, Li-An Chu, and Zack Draper), we analyzed a real world community of songwriters and their collaborators for the last 60 years using graph theory.

We adopted Markov chain to measure

* centrality

* connectivity

* clusters of the small-world graph

We've also explored multiple metrics to determine the size of the graph and the distance between individuals.
